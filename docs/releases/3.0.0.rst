3.0.0 Release Notes
===================

TODO

* Update to ASGI v3: update init and call **if you implemented** these yourself.
  (Otherwise you should be good.)

  * Means you need to instantiate your consumers when setting up your routing::

      websocket_urlpatterns = [
        re_path(r'ws/chat/(?P<room_name>\w+)/$', consumers.ChatConsumer()),
      ]

    Consumers are *single-callables*, taking the scope at the beginning of the
    request.

* Built-in `AsgiHandler` is deprecated. Update to Django 3.0+ and use its version.

* Explicitly specify `"http"` in ProtocolTypeRouter. (Deprecate auto usage.)

* Update your `routing.py` to an `asgi.py`

* What else breaks? Anything?

* Dropped Python 3.5

* Added support for Python 3.9

* Will require Daphne v???
