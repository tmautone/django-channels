3.0.0 Release Notes
===================

Update to ASGI 3
----------------

* Consumers are *single-callables*, taking the scope at the beginning of the
  request. You'll need to update init and call **if you implemented** these yourself.
  (Otherwise you should be good.)

* Consumers now have an ``as_asgi()`` class method you need to call when
  setting up your routing::

    websocket_urlpatterns = [
      re_path(r'ws/chat/(?P<room_name>\w+)/$', consumers.ChatConsumer.as_asgi()),
    ]

  This returns an ASGI application that will instantiate the consumer per-request.

  It's similar to Django's ``as_view()``, which serves the same purpose. You
  can pass ``initkwargs`` if your consumer requires them.

* Middleware will also need to be updated to ASGI v3 signature.

Other Bits
----------

* Built-in `AsgiHandler` is deprecated. Update to Django 3.0+ and use its version.

* Explicitly specify `"http"` in ProtocolTypeRouter. (Deprecate auto usage.)

* Update your `routing.py` to an `asgi.py`

* Dropped Python 3.5

* Added support for Python 3.9

* Will require Daphne v???
