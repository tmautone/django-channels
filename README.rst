Django Channels
===============

This is a work-in-progress code branch of Django implemented as a third-party
app, which aims to bring some asynchrony to Django and expand the options
for code beyond the request-response model.

This is still **pre-alpha** software, and you use it at your own risk; the
API is not yet stable.

Documentation, installation and getting started instructions are at
http://channels.readthedocs.org
